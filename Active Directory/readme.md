# Archived Default Domain Controllers and Domain Policy GPO extracts

This folder contains a bog-standard copy of the *Default Domain Policy* and *Default Domain Controllers Policy* files from a Windows 2012 R2 server (from memory)

These are useful as a reference if you end up in a domain environment where someone's (incorrectly) modified the default policies instead of creating new GPOs.
